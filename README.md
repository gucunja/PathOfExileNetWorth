# PoE NetWorth

**PoE NetWorth** is an overlay application written in C#. Problem it solves is desceptively simple - show player's networth and keep it updated while player is immersed in Path of Exile game. Inspired by Ziz's daily currency overview and racing overlays (timer, ladder position). In its full form, this tool should use a proprietary pricing engine API (under development at the moment) to price all possible items with reasonable accuracy.

[Download Latest release](https://github.com/gucunja/PathOfExileNetWorth/releases)


## Main Features

**Overlay:** show your net worth on an overlay so you can keep track of it during gameplay!

**Pricing source:** Poe.ninja API - every item on poe.ninja will be priced including links

**Items source:** Characters and stash tabs - can be customized

**Friendly developer :)** I am more than eager to hear everyone's opinion and use that to improve the tool
